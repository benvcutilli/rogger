This site is built on the Django web development framework.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
The design of this site is inspired by all my experience using the web. The
navigation bar at the top, the search bar, the Material-design(by Google)-inspired
layout and encapsulation of objects, the reverse-chronological feeds, etc. are not
my own creation; in fact, you will find very few things that *are* my complete
original ideas when it comes to design and aesthetics.

Also, a ton of this site is based on experience with merv.standford.edu, which
is a running log site whose users' exported data I support for importing.
