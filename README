THIS PROJECT'S REFERENCES ARE INCOMPLETE! I am currently busy with other
things, so I haven't cited everything yet. Take what you see here with a
grain of salt and don't fork this. I plan on redoing the site in the
relatively near future; you can fork off that if you please.

Rogger is a website built on HTML [87] (reference recommended by [88, top of
page]), CSS [90], Javascript [91], Python [93], Django [94] (recommended by
[95]), CodeMirror [96] (via [95]), jQuery [97] (recommended by [95]), and other
technologies that hopefully are cited throughout this code base. Rogger is
hosted on Linode [260] using Ubuntu [165]. Pip [168],
through the Django[94]-recommended Virtualenv [169], does package management.

Resources used to make this project can be found in this README (citations can
be found in the code base as well, using the common [#, locator] notation to
index each source found on this page; for any reference to the original version
of Rogger, you can find information on how to find that under the
"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" section), BUT NOT ALL CITATIONS ARE HERE! SOME ARE ALSO JUST
SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THIS REPOSITORY! Some may also be on just the server of the
website itself, and so you can't see the files, though I tried to be diligent
about putting those citations here. I also may have missed a few by accident.

The code for the old version of this site can be found at
bitbucket.org/roggerlogger/rog under the "refactor" and "master" branches (both
master and refactor have citations that may differ from each other, so look at
both of them)

PRIVACY POLICY

According to [62], [63], and [50], the GDPR [64] may be enforceable for this
site. So, this privacy policy addresses the GDPR (it's possible that [50], [57],
and/or [64] state that the existence of this privacy policy may be a requirement
of GDPR; however, I think I really added this because around the time of the
launch of GDPR (2018.5.25, I think, according to unknown references) so many
other companies were announcing new versions of their privacy policy).


Who has access to your data (each point addressed here is from
[57, Responsibility and accountability][50])?

Your data is almost completely kept on the web site's server and other Amazon
Web services utilities [65], and no one has access to it other than those
viewing the site (and depending on what you've set your privacy to). One
exception is that, when you create an account, Google [52] provides the
reCAPTCHA [53] that filters out the bots from the non-bots. I don't know exactly
what it sends to Google. Requests to the server go through the Domain Name
Service (which "History" of [56] says is defined by [54] and [55]), so that
could be a source of information leakage. The server is hosted by Linode [260], but everything
should be, in theory, pretty locked down with them. An administrator has full access to all data,
but I consider myself a benevolent dictator. For GDPR [64]-specific regulation, almost
everything is not held within the European Union.


How can I fix a problem in my data, delete my account, or get my data in a
downloaded form? (these subjects are from [57, Reponsibility and
accountability], [57, Right of access], [57, Right to erasure], [58], [59],
[60], [61])

Contact ben@rogger.co with any issues you have. Account deletion is provided through the "Settings"
webpage on the site; click on "Data Management".


Why are YOU allowed to touch my data? (from [57, Reponsibility and
accountability], [57, Lawful basis for processing], [50])

So that the site can function.


You store my data for HOW MUCH TIME? ([57, Reponsibility and accountability][50]
provided some version of this question)

Eternity, except for when you request account deletion, in which case at time
of the actual deletion, all of your data should be removed (unless part of the
deletion process fails or is not thorough enough by accident).


What does the program do with my data? (question origin: [57, Responsibility and
accountability][50])

Nothing crazy. The craziest it gets is just an algorithm to perform a search
in the search bar you can see at the top of the page.











SOME CITATIONS (using the number-in-square-brackets format commonly found;
the positioning of locators in those square brackets (as well as the comma that
separates the number from the locator) is also from some citation style as
well):

[1]   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4571686/django-include-template-from-another-app
[2]   http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp for picking colors
[3]   Google Fonts (fonts.google.com, Google, Inc.), from which you will find various fonts that were used throughout
      this site, loaded from the server fonts.googleapis.com
[4]   Padding seems to add width to at least divs, so the solution to this problem
      was found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23692739/4722104
[5]   For centering; this technique seems like common practice, and source is unknown
[6]   http://stackoverflow.com/a/3942399/4722104 for setting CSS to all elements of
      page
[7]   How to hide scroll bars: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23771140/4722104
[8]   Bullet points as information separators idea taken from Google Play Music
      (where they are used to separate album stats like time)
[9]   <br>s used in this div for line breaks is an idea from http://stackoverflow.com/q/12694110/4722104
[10]  Used the table display trick from here for vertical alignment of text:
      https://css-tricks.com/vertically-center-multi-lined-text/
[11]  Profile picture overlapping banner in the center of the banner idea from some unknown
      source
[12]  Whitespace can cause gaps between divs. Reduced font size to 0px to solve this problem.
      Source is unknown.
[13]  Removing drop down arrow for selects: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16603979/select-removing-dropdown-arrow
[14]  Using OneToOneField to mimic additional information added to built-in User model from Django documentation and unknown source (was used in previous project)
[15]  Passing csrfmiddlewaretoken into POST dictionary to fix the header thing not working is from and unknown source, but used
      in the previous iteration of Rogger
[16]  Used model reference from string found at this location http://stackoverflow.com/a/39712086 to resolve circular dependencies
      on imports
[17]  Differentiating between different button presses in form submission from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395807/proper-way-to-handle-multiple-forms-on-one-page-in-django
[18]  Help with putting string in raw format for javascript safety: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15392758 (used this answer and the comments on the answer for help)
[19]  Probably a commonly-used way to wrap a counter to mimic a ring buffer, but this code was at least sanity checked by, but possibly derived from, my knowledge that "Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach (Second Edition)" by Douglas Comer uses this technique
[20]  related_name naming scheme from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/db/queries/#following-relationships-backward (the FOO_set explanation part); also, I think I did this using-related_name-thing-to-resolve-migration-conflicts thing in the original Rogger project, suggested by a citation that I don't have on me right now, but this modification was recommended anyway by the django library when i tried to run the site, and I just followed those instructions, so citing the other resource may not be necessary
[21]  Using scrollIntoView() to scroll parent element to the element calling
      scrollIntoView() from unknown source. A span is used in the month that we
      want to scroll to as an element to target when telling the browser to
      scroll to it using scrollIntoView(...) (scrollIntoView defined by
      [106, 4.2.4])
[22]  This conditional, for calculating if scrolling has reached the bottom, from multiple sources that are unknown
[23]  noMoreUpdates variable for keeping track of if we received notice that no more updates were available is from the previous version of Rogger (codebase at bitbucket.org/roggerlogger), can't remember if I got this technique from an outside source
[24]  <br/> usage to break lines in ReportLab from unknown source
[25]  The strategy of allowing both approved and unapproved followers see user data if the privacy setting is set to public
      but then showing all follows that have occurred but still need to be approved when the privacy setting is public or more
      secure is from the previous version of Rogger; I don't think there are any resources that I used to get that strategy,
      but I can't remember everything that I used, so to be safe I will say that there is a possibility an outside resource helped.
      The "approved" attribute in the Follow model keeps track of whether a follow is approved, and, again, is only looked at
      if the user-who-is-being-followed's profile is not on the public setting.
[26]  This technique of a hidden form to be triggered from a remote button from unknown source(s).
[27]  Not sure if I used this kind of variable in the last version of Rogger and if there is a citation for it.
[28]  Using a presigned URL to control access to files in buckets is an idea from an unknown source.
[29]  Using middleware to remember when the user was last active from unknown source.
[30]  I was told by some unknown source that using the .dataset property in javascript isn't backwards compatible,
      so there was an alternate method discussed, which I believe was .getAttribute(), which
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes suggested.
[31]  Having display names is inspired by Twitter (and probably inspired by others as well)
[32]  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4571686/django-include-template-from-another-app
[33]  MIT License from https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
[34]  These types are from and/or inspired by the original Rogger (see url for the original Rogger below in the "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" section),
      and they were inspired by merv.stanford.edu, so they were not my own creation
[35]  These types are definitely from the original Rogger (see url for the original Rogger below in the "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" section),
      and they were from merv.stanford.edu, so they were not my own creation.
[36]  To seek to the 0 position in a BytesIO before sending the file with boto3 from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36274868/saving-an-image-to-bytes-and-uploading-to-boto3-returning-content-md5-mismatch
[37]  Properly setting up the form for picture upload from https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/forms/file.html
[38]  Using a table, tr, and td (and whatever tags show up that the browser puts in itself automatically) is
      an idea derivative to the answer(s) found here:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8468066/child-inside-parent-with-min-height-100-not-inheriting-height
[39]  Using height instead of min-height to specify a minimum height and learning that I have to use it on
      a <td> element is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19432092/can-i-use-a-min-height-for-table-tr-or-td
[40]  Suggestion to use CodeMirror as a syntax highlighter is from
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1619167/textarea-that-can-do-syntax-highlighting-on-the-fly
[41]  Confirming that escapejs is safe for use in Javascript strings that are within HTML files is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23331988/djangos-escapejs-filter-and-xss
[42]  I am not sure if this filter method to remove zeros from end of number is from someone else's idea. I feel like there is a chance it is, but I can't remember
[43]  merv.stanford.edu
[44]  This function name inspired by the name of Django's send_mail() function
[45]  Using the time.sleep() (or any time.sleep()-like function) function to rate-limit the emails being sent out is an idea from
      an unknown source.
[46]  The idea of creating this function is from the old Rogger, which also had a similar function
[47]  Chrome was complaining about how the CSRF cookie was not valid, so adding CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE and setting it to "True" to the
      settings file (which you can't see in this repository) is an idea from https://groups.google.com/d/topic/wagtail/opM27Qnj_NU/discussion and (an)other unknown resource(s).
      Adding SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE to the site's settings.py file is a suggestion from the Django documentation and probably from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40616115/django-403-csrf-verification-failed as well.
      (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/security/) and was inspired by the aforementioned source as well.
[48]  Explanation of what I need to say to users to abide by the the EU Cookie law(s) is from https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/ and http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm

      ahead-of-time. In this case, the calendar can scroll up and down, but
      since time is virtually infinite in both the past and future directions,
      we can't load the calendar of all time at page load, so instead when the
      user scrolls up or down enough along the months in the calendar, the site
      will load in new calendar data as it is needed.

[102] It may have been suggested that I include a feature, when creating a
      week's PDF (see "GENERAL CITATIONS" below) to allow the user to put custom
      name on the PDF. I don't remember who, if anyone, suggested this.

[104] I have seen many calendars that include, within the days listed in a
      month, days that are not actually in the month so that there are no empty
      spaces leading up to the first day of the month or trailing the last day
      of the month. This cited area takes care of that functionality.
[105] Searching for users may have been a suggestion from someone. Or it may
      have been inspired by some service doing such a thing. I don't know. The
      method of comparing the histogram of bigram occurrences between two
      phrases to determine how close they are (using the sum-squared difference
      between respective bigram's counts) may have been at least inspired by
      some sort of reference, but I can't remember what it was if that was the
      case.

[110] I think someone may have asked for the feature where the website generated
      a PDF from the workouts for a given week, or at least they asked for the
      ability to print the entries from that week. If no one actually requested
      that and I came up with it by myself, then the week timespan is based on
      the fact that Tom Donnelly, the coach of the Haverford College (in
      Haverford, PA, USA) would ask his athletes for their weekly running logs,
      at least when he was coaching the cross country and indoor/outdoor track
      teams from Fall 2008 to Spring 2012.

GENERAL CITATIONS:
This site has a lot of influence from Mark Crimmins' "Merv's RUNNING"
(https://web.archive.org/web/20170328042657/http://merv.stanford.edu/ provided
the title) at merv.standford.edu (now mervsrunning.com, also titled "Merv's RUNNING").
Some major ideas from there (but possibly not all of them if my memory is
failing me):
  - Creating shoes and tracking mileage on them in logs/adding them to log entries
  - Using a calendar layout (probably most influential is the ability to click on
    a date on the calendar to make a new entry for that date) (also, a lot of
    people hated Rogger's old calendar layout, so the new one is also in response to
    them), and Merv may have also inspired the idea of the current month
    displayed being controlled by drop-downs
  - Workout creation layout
  - Custom workout types (also a suggestion from a user)
  - Allowing users' profiles to go completely private with no or close to no
    hint of the account existing
  - The hidden profile (as in the user's page 404s) privacy mode, which was
    requested by Flora Berklein in person in March of 2016 (I think that's the
    correct date)
- Instagram for inspiring the cursive "rogger" that you will see throughout the
  site (like on the navigation bar, about page, maybe others I am forgetting).
- The purplish-grey and white-ish color set used around the site is derivative
  of the greyish-purple and white that Slack, the collaboration app, uses, and I
  probably have seen similar colors to Rogger's purplish-grey and whiteish color
  set elsewhere around the web as well, so Rogger's purplish-grey and whiteish
  color set could be derivate of those, too. Further, I may have used more that
  just one purplish-grey and/or whiteish color in Rogger, so these citations
  apply to those as well. I also had the side bar on the home page vs. most of
  the rest of the site be the same color scheme as Slack (the side bar was the
  purplish-grey while most of the other backgrounds/empty spaces were white or
  close to white, at least in the default theme of Slack as of 10:37 PM Eastern,
  not daylight savings, on 2017.11.11). Seeing as I took design choices like
  that from Slack, Slack could have also influenced the site in other ways
  besides the sidebar-other-spaces thing and the general color set. I don't
  remember anything specific, but I am just putting this here to make sure I am
  "covering my bases" when it comes to citing.
- Also, as I think I have stated elsewhere in this file, this site uses a lot of
  common features found around web
- Evan Hamilton and Joel Christian to their tiny-but-appreciated direct and
  indirect contributions to the old project (bitbucket.org/roggerlogger) of
  which they were part of the coding team, and their probably ongoing indirect
  contributions to this one.
- Everyday users of the site add their data to the site, so this data was useful
  when checking the correct operation of the site.
- This repository's/this project's version control is managed by Git [141]
  (git-scm.com)
- See [110] for another feature potentially requested by someone
- Allowing people to follow others is an idea from social media, such as [108]
- Protected but partially visible accounts, and blocking accounts, are ideas
  from the internet, such as [108]
- [114]'s list of sites that track users through tracking images in emails was
  helpful to at least reduce the concern that Amazon SES [115] was tracking
  emails sent out for Rogger.

DEBUG:
Thanks to everyone that submitted bug reports. Safari, the web browser, was very
important in debugging, and less important but still important were other
browser(s) probably including (but there may be others I am forgetting) Firefox,
Chrome, Internet Explorer (unknown release number(s) like 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
etc), Edge, mobile versions of these browsers or their derivatives (like the
browser used in the Google bar in Android and the iOS Google App).

SUGGESTIONS:
Thanks to everyone who suggested things to make the site better.


This site is built on the Django web development framework.

How to set up NGINX (the web server) to serve this Django app
is from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04,
http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html,
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-nginx-configuration-file-structure-and-configuration-contexts (for telling me where to put the Rogger server configuration (somewhere in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)),
and probably other unknown resources as well. (SEE OTHER CITATIONS BELOW, THEY TAKE PRECEDENCE)

Thanks to https://www.whatsmydns.net, http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/tools/visual-domain-routing, and other unknown sources, for helping debug the server.

Using json.loads() to convert strings with surrogate pairs into proper unicode for data import from a json file (for transferring between the old Rogger's "python manage.py dumpdata --indent <# of spaces indent>" output to the new database) is from
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38147259/how-to-work-with-surrogate-pairs-in-python and possibly others as well. Being able to transfer the data between two different databases via just
Django models, which is the idea that allowed me to generate the pseudocode that got the ordering of how to move the old data to the new site (in the end though, I didn't use the old database's
data with just models; I just used the pseudocode ordering), is from https://rlskoeser.github.io/2016/03/31/migrating-data-between-databases-with-django/. That site also may have pointed out to
me that I could use dumpdata to get the old data out of the old site. I suppose it is possible that that site outlines the entire original method I was going to use to transfer the data over,
now that I think about it, I just can't remember and if it was, I have modified it so that my data transfer code directly reads the output of "python manage.py dumpdata --indent <# of spaces to indent>".

Thanks to https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/are-they-limitations-on-who-can-use-lets-encrypt/687 for clearing up
whether or not I can use Certbot and Let's Encrypt on my site and still stay compliant by licensing the site code under the MIT License (below).

Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44892085/letsencrypt-certbot-timeout-error for helping me debug using Certbot and Let's Encrypt.

Thanks to https://lifehacker.com/5683682/five-best-domain-name-registrars for suggesting Name.com to use as a domain name registrar.

Using a virtualenv'd folder to house a Django project is an idea from (an) unknown resource(s) (high probability that is is from the Django's team's own django tutorials at djangoproject.com, and maybe other resources as well).

systemd-uwsgi-DAEMON-DEFINTION-FILE-SPECIFIC CITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------
It is probable that using systemd to start up (and coordinate) the uwsgi server for Rogger is a suggestion from
https://serverfault.com/questions/785502/create-daemon-on-ubuntu-16-04. Also, the structure of this file is based
off an example found at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sect-Managing_Services_with_systemd-Unit_Files.html
and possibly elsewhere.

ExecStart command is a derivative of those found at http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html, and possibly from
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04,
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/wsgi/uwsgi/, and maybe other resources

Setting Type to forking is a suggestion from (an) unknown resource(s)

WantedBy usage (from unknown resource(s) and https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files),
seems to be the best way to get this service running at boot, and possibly recognized by any systemd command.

Using the --home option for uwsgi is a suggestion from an unknown resource and discussed in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/wsgi/uwsgi/

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf rogger SERVER DEFINITION CITATION SECTION
--------------------------------------------------------
THIS SERVER DEFINTION IS A DERIVATIVE OF THE SERVER DEFINTIONS FOUND AT
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04,
http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html,
AND PROBABLY OTHERS.

Putting this server definition here (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) is from
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-nginx-configuration-file-structure-and-configuration-contexts

All sections in the server configuration section talking about how Certbot is its manager were created and/or modified by Certbot, not me
(basically, for those without access to the file, this is the code that redirects non-HTTPS connections to HTTPS connections, and
and certificate setup)

Method of redirecting non-HTTPS requests in the nginx rogger server config (The "if ($scheme != "https")" if clause)
was made by Certbot, and https://serverfault.com/questions/250476/how-to-force-or-redirect-to-ssl-in-nginx confirmed for me
that this was a way to do that and also pointed out that I can still listen on port 80 in the same server definition to allow
those non-HTTPS connections to come in and get redirected to the HTTPS site.

Thanks to https://serverfault.com/questions/814767/413-request-entity-too-large-in-nginx-with-client-max-body-size-set
for telling me what the variable is in the nginx configuration that controls how big a request is allowed through the server.
Limiting the request size using the web server instead of Django or something else is a suggestion from an unknown source.

This has been put in the nginx.conf file, and explanation for it is with it, along with its citations:
    # This server definition is used to reject requests that aren't for the domains processed by the server definition below.
    # The "return" usage is from http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html (retrieved 2017.12.18) in the code under
    # 'In catch-all server examples the strange name "_" can be seen'. Putting this as the first server to make it "default"
    # so that other domains are processed here and not in the other server is probably from the same page and/or
    # https://serverfault.com/a/525011. Making sure that these requests stop here and not at Django so that I don't
    # get spammed with error emails is an idea from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18220519/how-to-disable-djangos
    # -invalid-http-host-error. Even though this version of the site uses Nginx (and I think that site talks about Apache,
    # there might be some configuration used there that was directly, or more likely indirectly, relevant to what I wrote
    # for this server definition. Using two different listens for each port is an idea from Certbot which did this for
    # the server defition for Rogger.

DEPLOYMENT SERVER'S ROGGER INSTALLATION's settings.py citations (in addition to those that may have already been mentioned):
See citation [47]



Installation instructions I used for the production server (plus some other outside knowledge that I don't remember where it is from) were found here:
virtualenv:    With pip (not sure about source for this method of installation)
Django:        With pip (not sure where I got this from; may be recommended by the Django team themselves)
nginx:         https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/ (they talk about modifying the /etc/apt/sources.list file, which I did)
pip:           https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ (with the get-pip method + python3 instead of python)
ReportLab:     https://bitbucket.org/rptlab/reportlab (the README, with pip)
Boto 3:        https://github.com/boto/boto3 (with pip)
Pillow:        http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/installation.html (with pip, although ReportLab had already installed it as a dependency)
uWSGI:         https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html (with pip + "sudo apt-get install gcc" + "sudo apt-get install python3-dev")
Certbot:       https://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuxenial-nginx



Thanks to https://www.sqlite.org/onefile.html for mentioning that a SQLite 3 file is cross-platform (and I think cross architecture), which saved me
a ton of headache.





This site uses Django, JQuery, ReportLab, Pillow, Boto3, Let's Encrypt (a GREAT GREAT GREAT initiative) + Certbot (also FANTASTIC), nginx, Ubuntu 16.04 (the AWS variant), virtualenv, pip, CodeMirror, Amazon Web Services, and probably other things I'm forgetting to mention as well.

Thanks to Atom (developed by Github, I think) for being a (relatively) great text editor. It was used for the majority of the code that I wrote for this site.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
The design of this site is inspired by all my experience using the web. The
navigation bar at the top, the search bar, the Material-design(by Google)-inspired
layout and encapsulation of objects, the reverse-chronological feeds, etc. are not
my own creation; in fact, you will find very few things that *are* my complete
original ideas when it comes to design and aesthetics.

Also, a ton of this site is based on experience with merv.standford.edu, which
is a running log site whose users' exported data I support for importing.

-Zachary Gabor, Griffin Kaulbach, users "alphdollie" and "hdoll" (Issue: error gets thrown when no workout type is specified in new workout because they have not made any types, and the "Unknown" type has not been created for them)
-this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41787263/different-value-of-csrf-token-in-response-header-and-browser-cookies-csrf-verif, Greg Morgan, Allison Guindon, Nick Reynolds, Lukasz Tyler Olenginski, Lincoln Satterthwaite, Kristina Kronauer: for helping me debug that the browser will automatically look for a favicon, and will get a CSRF cookie if Django handles the request (as in not going to the static file URL) and returns a 200 status.
-Bernie Jones (for the above problem and also for debugging that usernames with spaces in them can get by the account maker), Zach Needell for the same usernames with spaces bug (calling django's reverse url lookup functionality failed with the URL regex I specified for getting the url to a user's profile page)
-user "thale" for automatic bug report suggesting that I had not done a make migration and/or migration when the backupType field was added to the "Workout" model in workoutLogging.models
-users that tried to make a new log entry but failed because they didn't know they were logged out (the new entry page allowed users through even though they weren't logged in) -- automatic bug reports were sent for those people's errors
-users "Ellie" and "nosbigibson" for their automatic bug reports that showed I had an index error for "pretty printing" python's Decimal type (I assumed that all Decimals would have a decimal point when converted to some string, which caused indexing problems)
-Matt Cohen for his automatic bug report for not importing django.contrib.auth.model's User model; that model is used to check to see if the user tagged in an entry actually exists
-the automatic bug report generated when some unknown person tried to access the "/search" resource without actually putting in something to search for
-the automatic bug report that an unknown person generated that triggered, in shared.tools.getErrorString(), an error that "creationForm" could not be found, which was an artifact of me moving code; I never changed that back to the real form's name (which is not creationForm) once I moved that code over
-an unknown user's automatic bug report that I think I had not imported shared.languageLocalization's "baseLocalization" variable into some place, but I forget where that import was
-unknown users' automatic bug report for helping me figure out why the 404 error template I created was not being found at the /hello resource
-Charlie Marquardt, Eric Arnold, maybe others for pointing out browsers not working with both www.rogger(beta).co(m) and rogger(beta).co(m)
-Lena Edelstein for pointing out that the date and time of comments were not local to the front-end's location
-Charlie Marquardt and Eric Arnold for helping to, I think, debug the fact that I had not made an A entry for my domain to route the domain to an IP
-Eric Arnold for pointing out that, for migrated workouts (from old to new site), some distances had too many decimals numbers
-Eric Arnold for checking that emails were being sent out properly (for some mechanism(s) that I can't remember, involved at least entry comments)
-Charlie Marquardt for pointing out that distances on the updates feed page were showing unnecessary 0s in the decimal portion (or just an unnecessary decimal portion) of the distance of workouts
-Charlie Marquardt for pointing out that scientific notation (a*eb, where a and b are numbers) was showing up for workouts on workout pages
-Charlie Marquardt for pointing out that PDF generation was throwing a server error (can't remember what that error was specifically related to, I think it had something to do with the fact that WorkoutWeek's getStats() function changed and the new version returned tuples instead of strings, so the tuple was passed to Reportlab (for PDF generation) instead of the a string, which caused an error)
-Mali Axinn for pointing out that logging in wasn't working for new users. Super weird bug. I haven't gotten a complaint about this until now, which is very confusing.
-Charlie Marquardt and Charlie Hale for pointing out that the domain wasn't routing to the old Rogger server when (I think) I was switching domain name service providers.
-Charlie Marquardt pointed out that the calendar would initialize to (I think) showing an adjacent or near-adjacent month to the current month in the old Rogger. This issue was resolved in this new version of Rogger.
-Joel Christian (and possibly others) who pointed out that IE support (I think primarily, if not completely, for older version of IE) for the old Rogger was bad. I made at least some of this site compatible with older versions of IE as a result, though honestly I stopped testing for IE a while ago.
-Joel Christian, and Sam Fujimori let me know that the site looked good. Eric Arnold said it is better-looking than the old version.
-Eric Arnold and others said that when writing the text of a log entry in the old version of Rogger, each press of the keyboard would make the cursor in the entry area to return to the start of the entry's text. So, for this project, I abandoned what was causing it (a hacked-up TinyMCE editor) for CodeMirror, which seems to have solved this issue.
-Mali Axinn (approximately 2017.9.26) and someone else (unsure of date when this occurred, sometime late summer 2017, I think): Mali's accounts needed to be deleted, so that helped me test that account deletion actually deletes everything related to that account, and that someone else had a bug that I created at least one account for to test out, so when I deleted those accounts, that helped to test that the account's data was being deleted. However, now that I think about it, it doesn't delete all the information, yet, so I have to address that at some point.
-Those (currently unknown who) who trigged the old site's bug where the antivirus would go down, so images couldn't be scanned for viruses on banner and profile picture uploads, and the server would error out, which would send me an email with a bug report. That's how I found out about these situations, and the bug is sort of fixed in this site (there is no antivirus running, so the same error can't occur).
-Eric Arnold said that the site was freaking out (it probably was with regard to Nginx complaining about the gateway; see two points down for further explanation of this issue), and it turned out that UWSGI hadn't been started. He probably mentioned this to me around 2019.2.17.
-I checked to make sure the TLS encryption (refrence for TLS unknown) was still working as Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/, Internet Security Research Group, site found by searching for "letsencrypt" on google.com) emailed me something that made me think it wasn't. I tested the encryption with Mobile Safari (https://www.apple.com/safari/, Apple Inc., site found by searching for "mobile safari" on google.com)
-Eric Arnold -- Besides previous time(s), he pointed out via text on 2020.3.6, call on 2020.8.10 (and a text on the same day in a separate instance of this problem) that he was getting a 502 code (defined by

My mom (Carolyn Cutilli), dad (Bruce Cutilli), and Eric Arnold helped with
suggestions on how to cite things and just also with my stress management (and
probably other things as well that I can't remember), so thanks to them. Eric
suggested that I can email all the users of the site to ask them to reply
telling me how they had helped out with the site, and then I can add them to the
list of citations.

Also, Eric Arnold told me that I was getting questions on runnerunner.com's
message boards relating to Rogger and said that I should chime in to help
address them and address the fact that merv.stanford.edu was losing users due to
spottiness of the site or other issues, and that I should encourage them to use
Rogger as a replacement. He also might have answered questions on
runnerunner.com in representation of me as I did not want to log onto
runnerunner.com to do so.

          relevant section - introduction
  in the "License" referred me to that license.

  In order to keep the database updated (as it is downloaded locally), I use
  geoipupdate (reference H) which was recommended by the "Updating Downloadable
  Databases" section of reference I.

  To make sure the database was updating properly, I used the command
    ls -l
  which told me the date the file was updated, or something like that. "ls"
  is a program distributed with reference K.

  Making sure that this non-US blocking technique worked comprised of using
  TunnelBear
    https://www.tunnelbear.com/
    TunnelBear
    author - TunnelBear LLC
  to connect to a VPN in Ireland, and trying to connect to rogger.co while
  expecting failure to do so as an indicator that the blocking code works.


  MaxMind changed its database download process so that you need to have an
  account to download its GeoLite2 databases (reference A). As a result, as
  instructed in reference A's "Steps for Migration", I
    - created an account at reference B (the confirmation page, reference E,
      that shows after signing up in reference B said to look for reference C
      sent to my email address; I followed the instructions saying to set a
      password for that account, using reference D suggested in that email to
      set the password)
    - went to reference F, and clicked on "Generate new license key", which lead
      to reference G. I named the key "Rogger Blocking", said the key was going
      to be used by GeoIP Update (reference H), and then said that the version I
      was using for GeoIP Update was equal to or higher than 3.1.1 (I determined
      this was the case by running geoipupdate --version on the server running
      GeoIP Update). I then clicked "Confirm", which brought up reference J.
      I took the "Account/User ID" value and "License Key" value and put them
      into the GeoIP Update configuration file which you can find at
      serverfiles/geoipupdateconfig in this repository.
  After following those instructions, I used
    geoipupdate -f <path to the GeoIP Update configruation file>
  to test that the database actually updates, and checked the database file's
  modification date (to see if the update succeeded) using "ls -l" ("ls" is a
  command from reference K) in the directory where the database is saved.

ENCRYPTION

This site uses encryption in order to be in (somewhat of) compliance with GDPR
[64]. Previously, the data on the server was encrypted using EC2 volumes [67]
that were encrypted by AWS [65], and the images that users upload were hosted on
an encrypted S3 bucket [68], also encrypted by AWS. However, as required by GDPR
according to an unknown reference, the encryption keys in both the EC2 volume
and S3 bucket scenarios should be handled by me, which they aren't. This was
the motivation for me to move this storage to an encrypted device on the server.
See "script" in the "ubuntusetup" folder for details about the encryption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concerns about devices being secure:

[115] brought to my attention an attack known as "Thunderspy" [116]. Besides
describing the attack, the article stated in its introduction that "99 percent"
of people don't need to worry about the attack (this thought process concluded
in [115, What's a user to do?] by stating that such attacks really only in the
reach of entities like nation-states), and this "99 percent" idea was followed,
I believe relatedly, with the fact that this attack was patched out of macOS
long enough ago that my laptop is secure from that kind of attack [115,
"Accessing Memory Lane" and "Intel assurances torn asunder"]. Other things
discussed throughout the article relevant to the security of this site include
  1. the idea that if someone can get to your computer in person, they can
     probably figure out a way to hack you [115, "Intel assurances torn
     asunder", "Accessing Memory Lane", "Sabotage ain't hacking"],
  2. Kenn White's quote which says that Thunderbolt can no longer be considered
     secure [115, Intel assurances torn asunder]
  3. Highlighting other attacks and saying that they were patched [115, Sabotage
     ain't hacking]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[118] stated that Django 1.11's [94] security support will end, and [117, red
page header bar] confirmed this, so this told me that I need to upgrade to a
newer major release version of Django. This idea of needing to upgrade to make
the site secure is also probably from [119] and maybe [120]; further, in the
past, I may have been encouraged to upgrade to Django 1.11.19 by [120] because
of security. To be more specific, [119] and [120] announced new versions of
Django being released; they didn't specifically say to upgrade).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[121] makes it clear that iPhones [122] that have been confiscated by
authorities should no longer be considered secure. I've never encountered such a
situation, but if in some insane scenario I do, this is good to know for the
sake of Rogger's security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(No longer true) Email [126] for this website is hosted by Name.com's email service [125]. I read
that email mostly with the iOS [124] Outlook app [123]. Outlook is very good at
determining which emails are important (through its "Prioritaire" -- from the
French mode of the app -- section of its inbox), so that is one reason why I used
it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been pointed out to me (I think initially) by [144], with [145], [146],
and [147, first picture, its caption, title, subtitle, and URL] (in that order
to the best of my knowledge) further encouraging that I should rename the
"master" Git [141] branch to something that at least avoids the master/slave
nomenclature ([147, first picture, its caption, title, subtitle, and URL] helped
indirectly through reporting that someone else removed the terminology). [148]
indicated that this wouldn't be a time-consuming process. [149] was talking
about a different repository circumstance, but it still helped (I didn't look at
the screenshot that came with it) to defeat the notion that changing branch
names would be difficult. After renaming it to "main", both

  git push --prune

and

  git push --prune origin

spat out

  fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match
  the name of your current branch.  To push to the upstream branch
  on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD:master

  To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD

  To choose either option permanently, see push.default in 'git help config'.

indicating that the "main" branch was still tracking "master" on GitHub. I fixed
this problem. This was not the end of the issues, however. Running

  git branch -a

warned me with this

  warning: ignoring broken ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD

I think this was the result of the HEAD shortcut trying to point to the last
commit of master (or something like that if my terminology is off). Running

  git remote set-head origin main

hopefully has fixed this (trying

  git push origin HEAD

didn't complain, at least). Fixing HEAD was attempted (unsuccessfully) as a
solution to GitHub [142] not seeing "main" as the default branch; I thought that
removal of "master" through the "git" command line tool was held back by the
fact that GitHub had the "master" branch as default, in addition to there being
a trash can next to "main" but not next to "master" [143, "Overview" or "All
Branches" pane]. However, attempting to change the GitHub default branch with
the previous command

  git remote set-head origin main

followed by

  git push --prune origin
  git push origin

was not a solution. I just deleted the branch through one of the five panes (one
of which is "Overview") at [143], resulting in its deletion, but without
removing it from the list of branches. Going to the "All Branches" pane made it
disappear; this was to make sure that as much (as I could tell) of the word
"master" was removed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When NGINX [150] fails to start (as determined by testing out the site with
Firefox [78]), it can be due to ngx_http_geoip2_module [151] not being compiled
for a new version of NGINX that was just installed (prior to upgrading NGINX,
reliable receipt of emails from Django's watchdog [152, ALLOWED_HOSTS] about
requests -- which have to go first through NGINX -- setting HTTP_HOST
[153, HttpRequest.META documentation] to something the website doesn't handle
suggested that the upgrade itself broke NGINX, not something previously which
would have prevented those emails from being sent). See
serverfiles/geoipmoduleupdate for how this issue is fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing the server via a terminal is done through "ssh" (command) from OpenSSH
[154]. AWS [65] recommended somewhere to use the -i option like so
  ssh -i <key given to me by AWS> <user>@<host>
in conjunction with the AWS-created key to do this. Recently (2020.8) I realized
that I didn't know exactly what "-i" did. [158]'s documentation for -i discusses
"CertificateFile", which I thought could be the certificates that the person
signing into the server presents to log in via an alternate protocol which we'll
call "AP" (an explanation of this method was
read from [158, Authentication]). However, this was not clear. It was
recommended by the "-o" documentation of that same man page that I could find
out more about CertificateFile by looking at [159]. The "CertificateFile" section
in [159] didn't provide any more information other than it further hinted with
"Specifies a file from which a user's certificate is read" that CertificateFile
is used for AP. [158, Authentication] told me to look at [163]'s "CERTIFICATES"
section for more information on how this works, which it did, but it didn't
clarify what CertificateFile was.

<Where to put the citation stuff back in>

I prefer to acknowledge those who got the site to freak out and put in a bug
report for said freak out. However, those bug reports often don't contain the
username of the person so that I know who to credit. Instead, they might contain
a "session cookie" [], and I found out from [160, Finding the user from the
session] (using the verbatim Python code from there, below), that I can get the
User object [] for that user (which contains information about that user) from
that session cookie's value:

At the request of an anonymous user, they wanted to delete their account. I had
a method that I wanted to use, but it needed to be tested (testing on production
is generally not recommended, but in this case I was very sure I was in the
clear and took precautions). Deleting their account confirmed that these
objects (settings.models.WorkoutType, shared.models.UserInfo), when deleting
that user's respective django.contrib.auth.models.User (provided by Django), did
indeed get deleted. Loading my account through a web browser [78] showed that
other things in the database (created by the general Rogger community) were not
deleted as a result.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As recommended by [161, Clearing the session store], I try, at least on occasion
(although I believe they imply to do it often), to use the "python manage.py
clearsessions" command Django provides.

[151] was used to block users from outside the US (because I suck at GDPR [64]
compliance and someone/something said that this is what the LA Times [162] did
as a temporary measure on the date of GDPR being active).
serverfiles/settingupgeoip contains the steps took to do this and
serverfiles/geoipmoduleupdate is how I install new verisons of [151].

Firefox version when using IP address as (allegedly) host: 68.0.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be (as it turns out -- according to either [50], [64], or both -- partially)
compliant with GDPR's option to encrypt data instead of anonymizing it ([64],
probably [50] as well), I created a separate volume to hold the database, and
that database is encrypted using AWS-controlled keys (the reason for the
aforementioned "partially"). [164], when right-clicking on a volume, clicking on
"Attach Volume", then choosing the VM to attach to, let me know that the device
path to mount can be unusual, and told me what it may be (/dev/xvdf, an Ubuntu
[165] and/or Linux [166] path), which I ended up using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had two errant Django migrations causing problems with Django's manage.py's
"makemigrations". Pip [168] told me via the command "pip uninstall Django" that
it " Would not remove (might be manually added)" those migrations. This implies
that those migrations didn't come with the Django package when it was installed,
so I felt safe deleting them myself.

Currently not a fan of the below license for the all-caps line (because someone
likely copied from someone else as that line is very similar to what you will
find in [127], [128] (Not just for Python [93] 2.0, as clarified by [131, Python
license link comments]), [129] (implied to be recommended over [134], in the
manners discussed below), and [130, points 7 and 8] (also implied to be the best
version of the license [131, license links section; "superseded" tag]), implying
a trend in the license-writing world of plagiarism). This was brought to my
attention by []. I tried looking at those licenses and others ([132], [133],
[134]), but they all had the same (alleged) plagiarism issues, in addition to
these problems:
  [132]: Its insistence on weak copyright, public domain and other potential
         liberal stances may conflict with other licenses agreed to by our project
  [133]: The text in red [133, under the license name] appears to question if the
         license is useful
  [134]: Another license that may be broken as the page says "This license has
         been superseded by the Apache License, Version 2.0" [134, comment
         preceding the license text] and [131, license links section] states in
         a comment next to the link to this license that its status is
         "superseded".
I also considered [135], but [131, license links section] suggested it had
something in common with [127] (the mention of "BSD"), so I avoided it because,
as previously discussed, [127] had plagiarism-probable issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for alternate domains, so [181], [179], [180] etc have been useful in determining which
domains I can buy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My domain that I use for testing was recommended by [208, one of the two horizontal scrolling things]

Moving server over to Linode

I wanted to figure out a way to (mostly) directly move the old server data over to the new server.
One thing I needed to move was the files from the AWS S3 bucket that hosts the images to the server
itself. I was reminded[215] of the AWS CLI[216] being able to do such things, so I attempted to do
that using the awscli[217] package on a testing server that had almost all the same properties as
the production server (this was done mostly to comply with GDPR's encryption requirement as the test
server had an encrypted volume, as can be seen in ubuntusetup/script). However, I kept getting told
that I wasn't permitted to fetch the images. [214, aduty's post] pointed out that I needed to grant
access to the KMS encryption key[218, "Customer managed CMKs"] for the IAM user[219, "IAM users"]
performing the download before I could move the files (I didn't quite understand their directions on
how to do that, but ended up figuring it out myself and then realizing later that my method was
what they were trying to say, less the fact that they weren't adding the permission for a user,
specifically). This worked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I moved my domain name (rogger.co) from Name.com[179] to Hover[222], the latter of which was
recommended by ATP during an advertisement [224].

When Name.com was used, I think I used the default value for TTL[55, 3.2.1] for every record or
almost every record when managing records with [235], and same goes for Hover's equivalent[236],
except I think the "Host" field for on of the A[55, 3.4.1] records was, by default, "@".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Needed to update unit[188] but wasn't able to; these steps[176, "Ubuntu"] fixed that:

sudo curl --output /usr/share/keyrings/nginx-keyring.gpg https://unit.nginx.org/keys/nginx-keyring.gpg

Added these lines

deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-keyring.gpg] https://packages.nginx.org/unit/ubuntu/ focal unit
deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nginx-keyring.gpg] https://packages.nginx.org/unit/ubuntu/ focal unit

to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unit.list.















I wasn't able to delete accounts because of a constraint violation in SQLite 3. A search on GitHub
turned up [250, "Foreign key constraints are now enabled on SQLite"], which stated that the solution
to this problem is "tables may need to be rebuilt to recreate foreign keys with the new definition".
I decided to use the "sqlite3" tool [251] to fix this problem, but it wouldn't run. Turns out that
[252, "Loren Hochstein"'s response] I needed to install [253]. Doing so resolved the issue, and
allowed me to proceed with implementing the constraint issue solution.




Security breaches were reported to users as required by [246].


Rogger wouldn't modify the database using "python manage.py migrate", stating or suggesting that
tables or whatever already had the stuff that would have been added via the migrations. I didn't
understand why that was the case, but it became clear after reading [257, response from Dan O'Boyle]
that every migration from the beginning was being run. This became clear when they discussed
"faking" the migrations with "fake-initial". I realized then that it may be that the database keeps
track of which migrations have been run, and that something wiped out that record for my table. I
therefore used combinations of "python manage.py --fake" and "python manage.py --fake-initial" to
get everything back in sync.

I needed an email host that could store email in a GDPR-compliant manner. It wasn't clear if
Tutanota legally fulfilled that need, but according to [258], you can enter into a contract with
them to do this as long as you get the plan that was meant for commercial purposes. Therefore,
that's what I did.

I heard of Tutanota from [259]
