# This re-uses commands (some of which have been modified and marked as such)
# from this file's folder's "settingupgeoip" file, so please look in that file
# for relevant citations. Commands not listed may involve packages installed
# (such as those commands involving "apt-get"); since these packages are already
# installed, any updating of them occurs when I occasionally run
#   sudo apt-get update
#   sudo apt-get upgrade
# as outlined in "The server update process was accomplished with these two
# commands" in the README
